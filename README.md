## Game Instructions

[Tic-Tac-Toe](./game-picture.png)

Tic Tac Toe is a game in which the main objective is to complete a row, column, or diagonal with the same symbol. Players take turns placing different symbols ("X" or "O") on the board, and the first that completes a row, column, or diagonal, wins. If no one completes them, then, the game ends as a "Tie".
