Tic Tac Toe is a game whose main objective is to complete a row, column, or diagonal with the same symbol. Players take turns placing different symbols ("X" or "O") on the board, and the first that completes a row, column, or diagonal, wins. If no one completes them, then the game ends as a "Tie".

## Game Instructions

- Run `bin/main.rb` in the Terminal
- Enter the first player's name
- Enter the second player's name
- Press Enter to start the game
- Each player must enter a number from 1-9 that's not already placed on the board
- The game finishes when all places are filled ("TIE") or when a row, column, or diagonal is filled up.
